# Following code  is   organized in   functionnal sections.  In   each
# section, steps (for vmdb2 point of vue) are defined.

steps:

  # SECTION 1/5: Prepare local environnement for new image
  # ------------------------------------------------------

  # Create one file with 4G size. File name is set by "--output" shell
  # parameter option

  - mkimg: "{{ output }}"
    size: 3G

  # Create  partition entry on new image  file. In  order to always be
  # compatible  with previous old systems  and tools, prefer partition
  # type "msdos" instead of "gpt"

  - mklabel: msdos
    device:  "{{ output }}"

  # Then create  one primary partition.   In order to support multiple
  # partitions,  create also one  logical name (option  tags) for this
  # partition.  It  is  therefore possible to use  this  name later to
  # reference this object.

  - mkpart: primary
    device: "{{ output }}"
    
    # We  have  to   start   higher    than 12M  because    of     the
    # tzsw.bin.hardkernel which needs  to be  at 24576*512  Bytes.  In
    # order to be  compliant on  all SBC, we  use  16 Mb as  a default
    # configuration
    
    start: 16M
    end:   100%
    tag:   rootfs_partition_tag

  # Map image file partitions to loop device

  - kpartx: "{{ output }}"

  # Format root partition with standard "ext4" Linux

  - mkfs: ext4
    partition: rootfs_partition_tag

  # Mount root partition (via loop device) on temporary mount point

  - mount: rootfs_partition_tag

  # Unpack a tarball of the root filesystem to the image, and set the
  # rootfs_unpacked  condition to    true.  If the   tarball does  not
  # exist,do nothing and leave the rootfs_unpacked condition to false.

  - unpack-rootfs: rootfs_partition_tag

  # SECTION 2/5: Create rootfs and minimal Debian configuration
  # -----------------------------------------------------------
